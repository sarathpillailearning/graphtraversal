# Graph Traversal using BFS and DFS


This is a small learning project on how to traverse a graph using BFS and DFS. The application also logs the time taken by both the methodologies.


## Learning

### BFS  :  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search

### DFS  :  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search


## Prerequisites

1. Java (https://www.java.com/en/download/)


## Installing

**Clone the project *GraphTraverse* to your workspace.**


Pass in the necessary VM arguments to execute the graph search.


*The graphs should have V vertices  and N is the starting vertice (the vertice to start traversal)
<br/>
<br/>
1 <=a <= 2,147,483,647 <br/>
2 <=b <= 2,147,483,647
<br/>
N >=1<br/>
V >=1 <br/>*

The VM arguments are passed as below
<br/><br/>
V<br/>
N<br/>
a b<br/>
.<br/>
.<br/>
.<br/>
<br/>



Compile and run the project
